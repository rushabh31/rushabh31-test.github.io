### Mapping Building Code Violations in USA

In 2016, I applied for the [Code for America Data Scientist fellowship](https://www.codeforamerica.org); while the position I was applying for was not available at CfA that year, the application process required an interesting data visualization/mapping exercise that I  enjoyed. The applicants were asked to make sense of a [dataset of building code violations in the United States](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/139s4K7sd0rzTIa40s3cOu_6aroACrMcJ3S8vcpYTjec/edit?usp=sharing), and develop a model based on this dataset. This was my first time mapping entirely with [Carto](https://carto.com), and below are my methods and outputs.
