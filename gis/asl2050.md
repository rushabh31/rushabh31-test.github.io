### African Sustainable Livestock 2050

During summer 2017, I worked with the [EcoHealth Alliance](http://www.ecohealthalliance.org) in New York on the [African Sustainable Livestock (ASL) 2050](http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/ASL2050.html) project. Our work aimed to characterize the poultry sector (domestic, commercial, and live bird markets) in six African countries. I helped develop the data sources and pipeline for this network characterization, and this work serves as the baseline for future scenarios of intensification in the region.

My final presentation for this project is available [here](https://aish-venkat.github.io/asl2050/index.html); NOTE: click the shield icon in the address bar and click "Load unsafe scripts" for the presentation to render properly. For accessibility, a PDF of this presentation is included below.
