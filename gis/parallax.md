### Parallax Map Gallery

Internationally-recognized artist [Shahzia Sikander](https://www.shahziasikander.com) (b. 1969, Pakistan) presented her first immersive animation Parallax, from September 16 - December 10, 2015, at Tufts University.Â Inspired by the United Arab Emirates's unique geography and culture at the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf, Sikander's 15-minute animation is constructed from hundreds of drawings and paintings, in which abstract, representational, and textual forms coexist and jostle for domination. This map gallery was created to contextualize the displays, and offer geographic, historical, and cultural perspective.
