### Mapping the Impact of California's Drought

In Fall 2015, I worked as an intern with [Ceres, Inc.](https://ceres.org), a sustainability nonprofit working on impactful investing to resolve challenges of climate change, water scarcity and pollution, and human rights abuses. With Ceres' [Connect the Drops](https://www.ceres.org/campaigns/connect-the-drops) team in California, I worked on a comprehensive analysis of California's groundwater and agricultural sector. This work is slated for publication in 2017.
