### Street Art in Boston

I have recently been intrigued by some of the murals and public artwork in greater Boston. However, I did not find a complete geocoded repository of this data anywhere, so I began developing this dataset. I first looked at existing sources such as WBUR's [ARTery](https://wbur.org/artery), but this provided a fairly sparse list. I am an avid Pokemon Go player, so I began thinking about scraping crowdsourced data on public art from Niantic, Inc.'s two games- Pokemon Go and Ingress. This led to my current project of curating a repository of permanent/semi-permanent public art and murals in Greater Boston. The draft dataset is available [here](https://github.com/aish-venkat/pokestops_boston), and my methods/results are shown in the infographic below. This is definitely still a work-in-progress that I'm pursuing at leisure, so updates may be sparse!
